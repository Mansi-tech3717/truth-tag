# 🧵 TruthTag – The Invisible Truth Behind Every Product

Hi, I'm Mansi 👋  
This is a simple project I created to show an idea that's really close to my heart.

## 💡 About the Project

**TruthTag** is not a fully functional website, but more like a concept design.  
It’s built using basic HTML and CSS to imagine how shopping could be more ethical and transparent.

The idea is — what if every product had a tag that tells you the *real story* behind it?

Things like:
- ✅ Was it made without child labour?
- 🌿 Is it eco-friendly?
- 💰 Were the workers paid fairly?

This website is just a mock-up to explore that thought.

## 📌 Note
This isn’t a real, working site with backend or product data — it’s just a design idea I brought to life using code.  
I made it to share a message and to improve my web design skills.
